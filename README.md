# NSF_ACCESS_template

LaTeX template to write proposals for NSF ACCESS requests. This template has been adapted from another template in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/nsf-proposal-template/xchskvnnkrnm)

This format is well suited for : 
1. Progress Report
2. Research Proposal
3. Renewal Proposal <br>
which are essential components of an NSF ACCESS proposal (Renewal or fresh). 

The current bibliography style is 
````
\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}
\setcitestyle{numbers,open={},close={},citesep={}}
````
In case you want to change to another style, please change these lines as per the [bibliography](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_in_LaTeX#Introduction) guidelines

For any questions or improvements to the current template, please contact me at [ssiddharth@ucdavis.edu](mailto:ssiddharth@ucdavis.edu?subject=Test)
